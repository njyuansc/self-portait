Manipulate your self portrait .stl with OpenSCAD (due Nov. 10th)
Use a combination of import() and for(){} to manipulate your self portrait.

import() function (info)
for(){} loops (info)
When imported, an .stl file can be manipulated like any other form (including intersect() and difference()).
IMPORTANT: The .stl file must be in the same folder as your OpenSCAD file.
Be sure to document on GitHub.
